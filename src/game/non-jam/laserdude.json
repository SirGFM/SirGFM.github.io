        "This game is a bullet hell shooter. It's also quite unbalaced, by the way... It also the first(?) occurrence of my complete lack of sense for names in games...",
        "Still, I'm quite proud of it. It's one of the few games (and the first, I believe) that I finished for no reason at all (though I later submitted it to SBGames 2013). And I really like some of the bullet patterns and the last stage's song."

# Games

List of games I've made outside game jams. Those games comes in two types:
simple post-jam versions of game jam entries and "complete*" games.

Usually, my deadlines for post-jam versions are until the next game jam. For
Ludum Dare entries, that would be around 4 months (minus the time spent rating
games).

"Complete" games are those not directly created based on a game jam entry. The
mechanic may be based on a jam entry, but the game itself is a completely
separated work (usually not sharing any code or asset previously made for a
jam).

Also, I may take breaks from these projects to do other stuff (like this site or
to take part of yet another game jam...). To ensure do I eventually release
them, I usually set a competition as the deadline (like
[BIG Festival](www.bigfestival.com.br)).

\* **Note:** I only wronte "complete" because I consider any game in this page,
one way or another, as complete... even the most broken ones...
